### Hi there ðŸ‘‹,

I'm Thiago,  
(pronounced **tchee**-Ah-go)

A software engineer, currently working at [EGYM](https://github.com/egym) and as the main developer of [EVO App](https://github.com/evolution-app).  
I am originally an iOS software engineer, and now I am working with tooling and firmware, mostly in [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/).

I love developing software, and I'm always looking for some fun projects to work on (even though my list is full of them), and I have no time, haha. I have loved [SwiftUI](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/swiftui/) since it was released, but yeah, there are moments I want to explode it ðŸ¤ª. [Swift](https://www.swift.org/), of course, is my ~main~ second programming language and most loved one. Since the beginning of 2024, I've been working more with [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/), but always jumping back to [Swift](https://www.swift.org/). [Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/) was my main IDE, but currently, I mainly work with [Zed](https://zed.dev), and the Terminal (pick one, or both: [iTerm2](https://iterm2.com) or [Warp](https://www.warp.dev)).
