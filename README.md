### Hi there ðŸ‘‹,

I'm Thiago,  
(pronounced tchee-**Ah**-go)

A software engineer, currently working at [EGYM](https://github.com/egym) and as the main developer of [EVO App](https://github.com/evolution-app).

I love to develop software, and I'm always looking for some fun projects to work on, even if I have no time haha. Since [SwiftUI](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/swiftui/) was released, I've become addicted. [Swift](https://www.swift.org/), of course, is my ~main~ second programming language. Since the beginning of 2024, I've been working more with [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/), and secondly with [Swift](https://www.swift.org/). [Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/) was my main IDE, but now I am also in love with [Zed](https://zed.dev), and Terminal is the best way to run anything. Now, I'm also working with [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/).
