### Hi there ðŸ‘‹,

I'm Thiago.

A software engineer, currently working at [EGYM](https://github.com/egym) and as main developer of [EVO App](https://github.com/evolution-app).

I love to develop software and I'm always looking for some fun project to work with, even if I have no time haha. Since SwiftUI was released I've become addicted. Swift, of course, is my main programming language. Xcode my main IDE and Terminal is the best way to run anything.

If you want to have a chat, just drop me a line on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/tholanda) or [Mastodon](https://mastodon.social/@tholanda).
